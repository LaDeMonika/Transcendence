### Description
A real-time multiplayer trivia platform where players pick categories, battle through quick rounds, and advance across tournaments. We are building a web-first experience for 3+ players with matchmaking, gamified rewards, and progression. Live leaderboards, achievements, and an analytics dashboard will keep competition lively and help us tune questions and balance over time.
